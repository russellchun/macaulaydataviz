#Introduction to Data Science/Data Visualization
##Macaulay Honors College

5 weeks x 3 hours = 15 hours = 1 credit course
Wednesdays, 7-10pm
June 3-July 1

It isn’t hyperbole: we are inundated with more data than ever before. From public releases out of the federal and local governments to social media feeds, remote sensors and web tracking, enormous amounts of data are being added to the collective database of information daily. What with all the measuring, scoring, and tracking of our activities, we are what the New York Times calls, “The United States of Metrics”. 

As big data becomes a norm in our lives, it’s valuable to learn how data analysis and visualization bring clarity to the heap of numbers. Effective analysis and visualization lead to better understanding, promoting awareness for researchers, policy-makers, and the public. Even the White House recognizes the crucial role of data and data visualization, having appointed Edward Tufte, a pioneer in the field, as a senior advisor, and establishing the role of its first Chief Data Scientist.

This hands-on introductory course teaches you to gather and analyze real-world data, and to develop effective and compelling visualizations. You’ll learn basic numeracy, data analysis, visual literacy, mapping, graphing, information design, and a bit of code. Participants are expected to produce a data-driven multimedia project, complete homework assignments, and engage in discussions on selected readings. We will partner with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (OCHA), who will provide data from their Humanitarian Data Exchange. 

##Course objectives
This one-credit intensive course explores the burgeoning and cross-disciplinary study of data science and data visualization. The course examines both conceptual and practical approaches to acquiring, cleaning, analyzing, and effectively visualizing data.

The course emphasizes:
* Understanding data and data types
* Data collection and provenance
* Basic statistical methods and concepts; numeracy
* Talking and writing about numbers and making responsible comparisons
* Exploring data: Identifying patterns and outliers in the data
* Design basics, effective visual communication, and data visualization
* Critical evaluation of professional data visualizations, i.e. the criteria that makes a project successful

##Course outcomes
At the end of this course, students will be able to:
* Search for and acquire data
* Identify trends in data
* Conceptualize clear and concise ways to visualize these trends
* Understand principles of data visualization and information design
* Discuss ethical issues in data science and visualization
* Create visualizations with a variety of tools: open-source code, web-based apps, and proprietary software
* Evaluate effectiveness of data visualizations

##Prerequisites
This is an introductory course with no prerequisites. The course assumes that students have no prior background in programming, statistics, or design. Students should be familiar with basic computer literacy, multimedia, and Web technologies.

##Faculty
Russell Chun is a multimedia developer, author, and educator specializing in visualizing science, data, and story ideas for the web. He is on the adjunct faculty at the City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate School of Journalism where he leads their courses in data visualization and serves as Director of Online Education. He is also Department Head of the Illustration Program at Sessions College for Professional Design. He is the author of books on multimedia software for Adobe, and has developed courses, and interactive and video products on effective multimedia. Russell previously taught at Columbia University and the University of California at Berkeley Graduate Schools of Journalism. He’s served as an interactive consultant and trainer for News21, a Carnegie/ Knight-funded national initiative to improve the quality of journalism education in the United States. He’s judged local and national multimedia news contests.

##Software Requirements
* Server space or a GitHub account for hosting multimedia visualizations
* An FTP client like Fetch or Cyberduck to transfer files to your server
* A text editor like TextWrangler or Sublime Text
* Tabula, to extract structured data from PDFs
* Open Refine, for cleaning messy data
* Microsoft Excel, Google Spreadsheets, or the open-source LibreOffice
* Google Chrome as your Web browser
* A Google account
* CartoDB for mapping. Register for the free academic account for unlimited tables.
* Potential visualization tools: HighCharts, Charted, Quartz ChartBuilder, Raw from Densitydesign.org

##Readings
* Alberto Cairo, The Functional Art
* Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information

##Grading
Your grade is determined by multiple factors: participation, successful completion of all homework assignments, and presentation of your final data visualization. Your participation includes attending all classes, being active in discussions, workshops and critiques, and participating in all in-class hands-on activities. Your assignments will be evaluated in terms of clarity of data, providing context, and design.
